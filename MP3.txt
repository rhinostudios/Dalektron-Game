HowlerJS

Known to be the best audio lib for js.
Howler aims for a balance of features and size;
buzz being the smallest. 
However Howler is built for use in game engines,
and has a "pipeline" feature. This allows one sound to finish properly before next one plays.
Also handles "interupts" properly too,
wherein one sound may be interupted by another one.

A very stable library, works without crashes and freezes
especially resiliant to interupts.
Exactly what is needed for HTML5
